# Cervical Cancer Subclass Classifier
This project aims to classify images into 5 subcategories of Cervical Cancer using PyTorch. 
It is part of a scalable framework that can later include classifiers for additional cancer types and subclasses.

## Features
- Subclass classification for Cervical Cancer images.
- Scalable design to support multi-cancer and subclass classification in the future.
- Comprehensive evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- Real-time training monitoring with [Weights & Biases (wandb.ai)](https://wandb.ai).

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joandies/cervical-cancer-classifier.git
